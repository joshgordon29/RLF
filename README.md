Rising Leader Forum Matching Algorithm 
Contributors: Josh Gordon, Joe Clark

This program was made to match mentors with mentees for Booz Allen's Rising Leader Forum (RLF) Intern Connection Committee (ICC).
The RLF ICC's goal is to add to the summer interns experience by providing  enriching and educational programs. Part of that 
is providing the interns with mentors they can go to for advice and networking within the firm. 

We match mentors with mentees on three criteria (ordered in importance):
1. Location
2. Capability
3. Market

We take two excel files from our forms we email out as our data, mentee-data and mentor-data. The algorothim matches all the mentors
and mentees and outputs a file of the matches with names and email addresses so that they can get in contact.
